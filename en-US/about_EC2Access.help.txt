SHORT DESCRIPTION
    EC2Access provides functions that can start a Remote Desktop session to a Windows instance in Amazon EC2.

LONG DESCRIPTION
    Getting remote access to Windows-based EC2 instances has always been trickier than the equivalent for Linux
    instances. Whereas with a Linux instance it is a single command to get a fully-functional shell, to get access
    to the desktop of a Windows instance you need to:

    1. Use the EC2 console to request the Administrator password
    2. Start the Remote Desktop client and give it the EC2 instance address
    3. Provide the Administrator credentials

    It's several more steps and each step involves several clicks or clipboard operations.

    This module aims to reduce this down to a single step, allowing a single command to start a Remote Desktop
    session with no need for completing dialog boxes or manually supplying credentials. It works by automating all
    of the above steps:

    1. The encrypted blob containing the Administrator password is fetched and then decrypted locally.
    2. The Administrator credentials are pre-loaded into the Remote Desktop client's credential store, so there is
       no need to manually enter them when making the connection.
    3. The Remote Desktop client is started using the hostname for the EC2 instance.

    Furthermore, Systems Manager Session Manager's port forwarding functionality is fully integrated. If an EC2
    instance is configured for Session Manager, then this module can connect using a Session Manager forwarded
    port, even if the instance is not reachable on a public IP address.

    To be able to decrypt the Administrator password, you will need the private key. Typically, there are two ways
    to get a private key.

    1. Creating a keypair on the EC2 "Key pairs" page. EC2 will generate a private+public key pair and store the
       public key. The private key is downloaded to your workstation as a file with a ".pem" extension - it is
       then discarded by AWS so make sure that you keep the downloaded private key file.
    2. Creating a keypair on your workstation. This is usually done using with the "ssh-keygen" tool that comes
       with Git for Windows or the Windows native OpenSSH tools if you have installed them. By default this
       creates the private key in ".ssh\.id_rsa" in your home directory, and corresponding public key with the
       same name with a ".pub" extension. Then, using the "Import" button on the EC2 "Key pairs" page to import
       the public key.
    
    By default, the functions in this module will assume that your private key is in the ".ssh\id_rsa" file in
    your home directory, which will be the normal situation in method 2 above. If you have used method 1, or have
    your key in any other location, simply pass a "-PrivateKeyFile" parameter to the functions with the path to
    your private key file.

EXAMPLES
    If your EC2 instance is configured for Systems Manager Session Manager, and if you have installed the AWS
    Session Manager plugin tool, then you can start a Remote Desktop session with this command:

    C:\> Start-EC2RemoteDesktopViaSessionManager i-12345678abcd

    This assumes your instance is in the default region, as specified in environment variables or your AWS client
    configuration files. You can specify the region explicitly:

    C:\> Start-EC2RemoteDesktopViaSessionManager -InstanceId i-12345678abcd -Region eu-west-2

    You can specify the location of the private key file:

    C:\> Start-EC2RemoteDesktopViaSessionManager -InstanceId i-12345678abcd `
                                                 -PrivateKeyFile C:\Users\joe\Downloads\windows.pem

    If your EC2 instance is reachable on its public IP address, then instead of
    "Start-EC2RemoteDesktopViaSessionManager", you can invoke "Start-DirectEC2RemoteDesktop". This function takes
    exactly the same parameters but uses the public IP address instead of Session Manager port forwarding.

    C:\> Start-DirectEC2RemoteDesktop -InstanceId i-12345678abcd -Region eu-west-2
